# OneCard Revisited
This is an iteration of my capstone project for Galvanize Immersive Coding Program. The initial capstone challenge was to build out an application using a technology entirely new to me in a week's time. The repository for the original oneCard can be found amongst my other repositories, and I decided to keep the orginal mostly untouched after the capstone showcase as a bookmark for first experience learning a new technology in such a short period of time. 

This app was conceived to serve as a virtual business card sharing application. Users can create a personal card with all relevant information pertaining to their business and social profiles to be kept in one place and shared via the scanning of a QR code or searching for users by name. Virtual cards are collected and stored in a user's wallet for viewing. 

## Technologies Used:
This app was created using Flutter and utilizes multiple services provided through Firebase, i.e. Firebase Auth API and Realtime Database.

## Ongoing Work
I am currently working on a way to further the user search functionality and plan on implementing a network tab that will utilize Google's Maps and Places APIs to allow users to check into a location and the ability to see the other users currently checked into that same location.
